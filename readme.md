# mboxfromlist
Generates a list of all the senders in a mbox file.

### Usage

`python3 main.py /path/to/mbox/file`

## Purpose

This had the goal of producing a list of senders emails so that I could use them to produce a graph of where most emails come from.
There are probably many other uses for this but none of which I am focused on. In the future I may expand this to include the graphing
component if I use python for this purpose.

## Comments/Fixes

If you have a better way to implement something here please create a pull request so that I can learn from it. I'm aware that
this is not the most optimal way to do things and am interested in learning. Any comments/requests please open an issue.
